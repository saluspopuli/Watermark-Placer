# Watermark-Placer

 Python script I cooked up in 10-minutes to place a watermark on a hundred photos (Who has time for that?).

 Requires the background images to be all of the same extension and resolution (not really)

 Files to convert, as well as watermark, and the script must all be in the same folder.
